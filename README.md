## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide insights into sales performance by analyzing sales data. The insights can help the company make informed decisions to improve sales strategies and overall business performance.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
The sales data is collected from a SQLite database. The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the basic characteristics of the data. Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, sales by region, and sales by product category are calculated.

## Trend Analysis
Sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are analyzed to identify peak sales periods and potential seasonal patterns.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent sales trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution.

## Reporting
The findings and visualizations are compiled into a comprehensive report.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- sqlite3
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
